    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h2>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</h2>
    <h3>It is designed to be displayed in a web browser</h3>
    <h4>It defines the content and structure of web content</h4>
    <h5>It is often assisted by technologies such as CSS</h5>
    <h6>HTML elements are bulding blocks of HTML pages</h6>

    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript,
         which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
          The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
           The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards,
            has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.
            [3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the  element, together with JavaScript.

            NB: HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, lists, quotes.
             HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets
